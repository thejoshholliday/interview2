  <h2>Interviewed by Joshua Holliday</h2>
    <hr></hr>
  <h3>" Growing up, I felt that my parents were quite strict, and in combination with the fact that I was never very successful academically, I felt I put a lot of pressure on my parents, which they happily reciprocated back towards me. "</h3>

  <h4> Born and raised in Cupertino, California; Hugo writes to me where he is currently staying at for the remainder of the fall semester. He is staying with his family consisting of his two parents as well as his older sister. His parents immigrated from Taiwan, where Hugo grew up learning his first language of Mandarin, followed by English. His main areas of interest are Badminton, Origami, Chinese Yoyo, while having a love for video games and tech. Hugo also makes a disclaimer before our interview about Hugo is his nocturnal habits which leads to his restless sleep schedule before "force flipping it back." </h4>

         <div class="josh"> <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> Having immigrant parents, is there anything that you see in them that inspires or motivates you? What motivates you to work hard?</span> </div>
          <div> <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span> I can definitely see the sacrifices they've to give my sister and I this better learning/growing environment, so that's kind of a key motivator. Unfortunately, I am quite a lazy individual, and that often comes off as lacking motivation to do work, which is true to an extent but isn't the message I'm trying to convey. </span> </div>
         </div>
     <div class="section2">
          <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> As you mentioned living in the same town as Apple headquarters, do you believe there was any influence on your own personal interest in the tech world? If not, what characteristics of technology/video games attract you to it? 
          <div></div>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
        The influence to the tech world isn't so much a result of living in Cupertino, but rather was influenced by my dad. My dad works as an IT engineer, so his job is a lot of troubleshooting and helping others with their tech problems. As a result, he'd often teach me how to fix certain problems when they arose in our family's machines.

     <div class="section1">
          <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> What is your favorite childhood memory?
          <div></div>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
        Oh this one's kind of hard, and probably depends on the limits of the "childhood" and how old it you believe it stops being childhood, but in the summer of my senior year, since I was kind of done with all of my work and waiting to go off to college, I participated in a lot of badminton tournaments, and I made a pretty close group of friends that would've never met if it weren't for that summer.
         </div>
         <div class="section2">
          <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> What is one thing you could not go a day without?
          <div></div>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
         Computer. I know a lot of people's answers would be their phones, but surprisingly, I much prefer using my computer over my phone, and part of that's because of quarantine and kind of the value of portability going down, but also because my phone's super old and lags/crashes a lot. It's honestly kind of frustrating to use haha.
     </div>
       <div class="section1">
          <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> If you could share a meal with any 4 individuals of your choosing, living or dead, what would be the meal and who would they be?
          <div></div>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
         Korean fried chicken, and as for who, it'd probably be a tie between friends and family. Who in my family I'd choose isn't really a question because it comes out to exactly five people, but for friends, that would depend on the mood and day.

       <div class="section2">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> As you were born and raised in California, coming to NYC, were there any major differences culture-wise that stood out to you? Anything in California you believe is lacking in NYC?
          <div></div>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
        These two locations are so different, anything from the subway to people's attitude, work environment, pretty much anything you could pick out, would be different in some way or another. As for lacking, that's kind of a tough question to answer, because neither locations is lacking one thing or another, but rather has replacements or different solutions for completing a certain task. The main one that comes to mind is transportation, in california, pretty much no one uses public transportation. It's just not as well developed as the one in New York, and as you probably know, public transportation is a huge thing in New York. The city would fall into utter chaos if all of the subway lines just randomly shut down.

       <div class="section1">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> What are the key parts of your Taiwanese culture that you greatly appreciate and involve in your daily personal life? Any favorite family traditions/recipes?
          <div></div>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
       Hmmm, the only thing I can think of is the chinese yoyo. it's been a pretty large part of my life since I was a kid. As for the recipe, that would definitely be stinky tofu. My parents don't really make it, I don't think they even know how to, but my grandpa used to be a food stand owner that sold it. 
           </div>
       <div class="section2">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> Where do you see yourself in 10 years? <br>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
    So that'd make me 29, I hope I'd have a pretty stable job working as a Graphic Designer. I don't really have to make a lot of money, probably enough to live a normal life plus consistently save money to go by. I hope I can still keep all of my hobbies until then and even later, as they've been such a big part of my life, but you never know I guess...

       <div class="section1">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> What are your pet peeves? <br>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
    Annoying people in general, like whether that be how someone acts, or their personality. Maybe a way they talk or even their body odor. I know a lot of these are completely out of people's control, but the blunt truth is that that doesn't stop them from bothering me. I don't let it get to me though, I think I'm a pretty non-judgemental person in the regards that I respect everyone and how they act.
    </div>
       <div class="section2">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> How would your friends describe you? <br>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span>
    No clue. As a joke they'd probably spout out a lot of harmful adjectives, but that's exactly what it is, a joke. On a serious note though, it honestly depends on the friend. My closer group of friends probably sees me as a loud quirky, fun guy, but with other's I can go hours in a group without speaking a word and just listening to others talk among themselves, so a really quiet person.
    </div>
       <div class="section1">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> What would you sing at karaoke night? <br>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span> Nothing, to put it bluntly, I don't really like to sing, and I find it pretty embarrassing to express myself in that way.

       <div class="section2">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> If you could visit either the past or the future, what would you choose? Why? <br>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span> Past, because going into the future holds consequences in that I'll be seeing things that I shouldn't see, the past is different in that these things have already happened, so it'd be just... a glorified history class.

    <div class="section1">
       <span class="bold poplar">Josh</span> Thanks so much for chatting with me today Hugo! <br>
          <span class="bold poplar">Hugo</span> It was my pleasure!
